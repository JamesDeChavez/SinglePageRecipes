# Single Page Recipes

[Link to Website](https://www.singlepagerecipes.com/).

A website I created to help users easily learn new recipes from Youtube, save them to their recipe books, and automatically add recipe ingredients to their Amazon Fresh shopping carts.

Additionally, the single-page interface of the recipes ensures all important info is easily available while cooking. No annoying scrolling!
